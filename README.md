## Bus Arrival Monitor (B.A.M.) - Hackday Project
March 2024
          
Serverless Slack bot built with Slack Bolt for Python and AWS Lambda that queries the DoubleMap API for bus ETAs for CDL.

The Arduino display utilizes an ESP8266 and 32x8 LED grid to create an alternative option for viewing bus ETAs. This also fetches data from the DoubleMap API in C++. View the Arduino code [here](https://github.com/cayb0rg/esp_bus_display)
